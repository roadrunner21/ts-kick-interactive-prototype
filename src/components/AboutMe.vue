      I am a software developer with over a decade of experience specializing in JavaScript across the stack, particularly in frontend development with React and Vue. My career began with a 4-year apprenticeship in software development, where I developed production planning software and conducted process optimization for small to medium-sized companies. Following that, I transitioned to full-stack web development with Laravel and React. In the past five years, I've further specialized in JavaScript, focusing on Node.js, Vue, and React, while still handling some backend tasks for smaller projects.
